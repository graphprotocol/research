# Mappings API

## Overview
Mappings define how data is extracted or ingested from one or more data sources, transformed, and then loaded in a format that follows a specific data model. At their core, mappings are simply WASM modules, and the mappings API is a set of host external functions that are injected into the WASM runtime and implement a specific interface. These function interfaces are in-protocol.

Additionally, extra-protocol APIs may be defined in userspace, which implement an API in a higher-level language that compiles to WASM. The Graph Protocol team created one such API, which is included here as a reference example.

## WASM API
The Mappings API can be split into two portions, the *ingest* or *extract* API and the *store* API (how data is loaded). We present an ingest API tailored to event-sourcing Ethereum smart contract data, but future versions of the protocol will enable ingest APIs specific to other decentralized data sources. The *store API* will not need to change to support new data sources.

**Note:** There are also a number of utility functions that are currently injected into the WASM runtime for convenience. These will either be implemented natively in WASM or fully specified in a future version of this spec.

### Ingest
#### Ethereum
Data is ingested from Ethereum by event-sourcing Solidity events, as well as other triggers, defined in the subgraph manifest. The WASM module referenced in the subgraph manifest is expected to have handlers that correspond to the handlers defined in the [subgraph manifest](../subgraph-manifest).

See this [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/runtime/wasm/src/host.rs) for how these handlers should be called.

Additionally, we inject functions for calling Ethereum smart contracts for additional data that is not included in the Ethereum event:
- ethereum_call

See this [reference](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/runtime/wasm/src/host_exports.rs) for these additional functions.

### Store
The store API includes the following methods:
- set
- get
- remove

See this [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/runtime/wasm/src/host_exports.rs) for these external functions.

### Utilities
We currently inject the following utility functions into the WASM runtime, which may be changed or removed in a future version of the protocol:
- bytes_to_string
- bytes_to_hex
- big_int_to_hex
- big_int_to_i32
- json_to_i64
- json_to_u64
- json_to_f64
- json_to_big_int
- crypto_keccak_256
- big_int_plus
- big_int_minus
- big_int_times
- big_int_divided_by
- big_int_mod
- string_to_h160

See this [reference implementation](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-node/blob/master/runtime/wasm/src/host_exports.rs) for these external functions.

## Higher-Level APIs
Higher-level APIs provide context for the low-level APIs, described above, in a higher-level programming language that compiles to WASM.

### AssemblyScript
[AssemblyScript](https://github.com/AssemblyScript/assemblyscript/wiki) is a subset of TypeScript that compiles to WASM. It only natively supports a handful of types, 32 and 64-bit floating point and integer numeric types, but we extend the runtime with additional higher-level types, such as `TypedMap` and `BigInt`, to facilitate a more developer-friendly API.

See this [reference](https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-ts/blob/master/index.ts) for all types, external functions, and utilities.
