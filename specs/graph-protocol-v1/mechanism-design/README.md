# Mechanism Design

## Overview
The protocol implements a *work token* token model[[1]](#footnotes) in which Indexing Node operators stake a deposit of tokens for a specific dataset, to participate in a data retrieval marketplace - indexing data and responding to read requests in exchange for micro payments. This deposit is forfeit in the event that the work is not performed correctly, or is performed maliciously, as defined in the [slashing conditions](#dispute-resolution).

There are secondary mechanisms in the protocol which also require a staking of tokens, such as curation, stake delegation, and name registration, all of which will be expanded upon in their respective sections.

## Graph Token
We introduce a native token for the protocol, Graph Tokens, which are the only token that may be used for staking in the network. However, ETH is used for paying for queries, thus reducing friction for end-users of dApps which query The Graph. Graph Tokens will have variable inflation to rewards specific activities in the network.

## Governance
There are several parameters throughout this mechanism design which are set via a governance process. In the v1 specification, governance will consist of a small committee which enacts changes to the protocol via a multi-sig contract.

## Staking
Indexing Nodes deposit a `stakingAmount` of Graph Tokens in order to process read requests for a specific dataset, as defined by the `subgraphID`.

For a `stakingAmount` to be considered valid, it must meet the following requirements:
 - `stakingAmount >= minimumStakingAmount` where `minimumStakingAmount` is set via governance.
 - The `stakingAmount` must be in the set of the top N staking amounts, where N is determined by the `maxIndexers` parameter which is set via governance.

Indexing Nodes who have staked for a dataset, are not limited by the protocol in how many read requests they may process for that dataset. However, it may be assumed that Indexing Nodes with higher deposits, will receive more read requests and thus collect more fees, all else being equal, as this represents a greater economic security margin to the end user.

## Data Retrieval Market
The work Indexing Nodes perform for the network can be described by a function of the type `ReadRequest -> ReadResponse`.

A `ReadRequest` comprises the following parts:
- `readOperation`
- `subgraphID`
- `blockNumber`

A `ReadResponse` comprises the following parts:
- `data`
- `attestation`

Additionally, a `ReadRequest` is sent alongside a `lockedBalanceTransfer`. This is a conditional micropayment, which can only be unlocked with a valid `ReadResponse` for the given `ReadRequest`. See Payment Channels for more info.

**TODO** Add link to Payment Channels section when ready.

**TODO** What parameters are sent along with the conditional micropayment?

## Verification

### Fisherman
Fisherman are economic agents who verify read responses in exchange for a reward in cases where they detect that an Indexing Node has attested to an incorrect response, and the Fisherman successfully disputes the response on chain.

### Dispute Resolution
Dispute resolution is handled through an on-chain dispute resolution process. In future versions of the protocol this may involve programmatically verifying proofs, or using a Truebit-style verification game, but in the v1 specification the outcome of a dispute will be decided by a centralized arbitrator interacting with the on-chain dispute resolution process.

In order to dispute a response, a Fisherman must submit the attestation of the response they are disputing as well as a deposit equal to that of the Indexing Node who produced the response.

In the event of a successful dispute the Indexing Node forfeits their entire deposit of tokens they staked on the dataset for which they produced an incorrect response. The Fisherman, in turn, receives a reward equal to 50% of the slashed deposit.

In the event of an unsuccessful dispute, the Fisherman forfeits the entire deposit they submitted with their dispute.

## Market Discovery

### Market Signals
Market discovery is the process by which Indexing Nodes choose which datasets to index and serve data on.

When the data retrieval market for a particular dataset is active, an Indexing Node may observe payment activity on-chain in order to decide if it would be profitable to participate in that market.

**TODO** How often should micropayment channels be settled so that the signal to the network is adequate?

With little to no activity for a newly created dataset, however, payment activity provides a poor signal. Instead, this signal to the network is provided by a *Curation Market*.[[2]](#footnotes)

### Curation Market
*Curators* are economic agents who earn rewards by betting on the future economic value of datasets, perhaps with the benefit of private information.

A Curators stakes a deposit of Graph Tokens for a particular dataset in exchange for dataset-specific *Subgraph Tokens*. These tokens entitle the holder to a portion of a curation reward, which is paid in Graph Tokens through inflation. See [inflation rewards](#inflation-rewards) for how curation reward is calculated for each dataset.

Subgraph tokens are issued according to a bonding curve, making it more expensive to mint subgraph tokens by locking up ETH over time, and thus more expensive to purchase a share of future curator inflation rewards over time.

**TODO** Define bonding curve for curation market or bonding curve parameters.

## Inflation Rewards
The total monetary inflation rate of Graph Tokens, over a given inflation period (more on this later), is the sum of its two constituent components:

`inflationRate = curatorRewardRate + participationRewardRate`

As indicated in the formula above, inflation is used to reward curation of datasets and participation in the network.

### Participation Adjusted Inflation
In order to encourage Graph Token holders to participate in the network, the protocol implements a participation-adjusted inflation[[3]](#footnotes) reward.

The participation reward to the entire network is calculated as a function of a `targetParticipationRate` which is set via governance. If `actualParticipationRate === targetParticipationRate` then `participationRewardRate = 0`. Conversely, the lower the actual participation rate is relative to the target participation rate, the higher the participation reward will be.

**TODO** Decide on actual function for relating `participationRewardRate` to `targetParticipationRate`.

In order to incentivize actual work being provided to the network, not just staking, the participation reward will be distributed to Indexing Nodes who are staking for datasets with the most economic activity.

Let `participationReward[s[i]]` be the participation reward allotted to Indexing Node `i` staked on dataset `s`. Let `transactionVolume[s[i]]` be the economic value of all data retrieval fees paid to Indexing Node `i` for data from dataset `s` over a given inflation period, and `totalTransactionVolume` be the total transaction volume for the entire network over the same period, both measured in ETH. Then we can define the participation reward as `participationReward[s[i]] = (transactionVolume[s[i]] / totalTransactionVolume) * participationRewardRate * totalTokenSupply`.

**TODO** How to deter Indexing Nodes from faking data retrieval transactions in order to claim a greater portion of the participation reward?

### Curator Inflation Reward
The `curationRewardRate` is defined as a percentage of the total Graph Token supply, and is set via governance. As with the participation reward, it is paid via inflation.

Let `grossTransactionValue[s]` be the total value of all transactions in the data retrieval market for a dataset `s` over a given inflation period. We can define `curationReward[s]`, the total curation reward shared by all Curators of a dataset `s` over a given inflation period:

`curatorReward[s] = (grossTransactionValue[s] / totalTransactionValue) * curationRewardRate * totalTokenSupply`

The share of this dataset-specific curation reward that an individual Curator receives is determined according to the share of the curator reward they have acquired in the [curation market](#curation-market).

### Inflation Periods
Inflation rewards are calculated over a period of time, measured in blocks, according to a `roundDuration` parameter which is set via governance.

For a given round `R`, the inflation rewards for that round are made available at the end of round `R+1`.

This provides adequate time for off-chain micropayments to be settled on-chain. This settlement on-chain also provides a [market signal](#market-signals), so `roundDuration` should be set sufficiently small to provide a good market signal, but sufficiently large to reduce the amount of on-chain transactions required to redeem inflation rewards on an on-going basis.

## Stake Delegation
Participation in the protocol is a specialized activity. In the case of curators it entails accurately predicting the future value of datasets to the network, while in the case of Indexing Nodes it requires operating infrastructure to index and serve data.

Token holders who do not feel equipped to perform one of these functions may *delegate* their tokens to an Indexing Node who is staked for a particular dataset. In this case, the delegator is the residual claimant for their stake, earning participation rewards according to the activities of the delegatee Indexing Node, but also forfeiting their stake in the event that the delagatee Indexing Node is slashed.
