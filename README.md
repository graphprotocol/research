# Graph Protocol Research

This repo contains specification and white papers related to The Graph, a decentralized query protocol for the decentralized web.

## Stages
These stages apply to papers, specs and proposals.

| Stage | Description | Badge |
| :----- | :----------- | -----: |
| **WIP**       | Specifications which are in progress. Has gaps and is actively being changed and added to. | ![WIP Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-wip-%23C25F38.svg)
| **Draft**     | Specification is a complete draft. Subject to change heavily. | ![Draft Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-draft-%23E3CB63.svg)
| **Stable** | Specification is at a state where it is relatively stable. Only slight improvements should be made to the spec. | ![Stable Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-stable-%233CBFC2.svg)
| **Finished**     | Specification has been fully implemented and should not change, except to address critical issues | ![Final Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-finished-0075AB.svg)
| **Deferred**  | Specification made it to at least the "Draft" stage but was later rejected. | ![Deferred Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-deferred-30324F.svg)

## Papers
- [The Graph Whitepaper V1 [Deprecated]]() ![Deferred Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-deferred-30324F.svg) - This was the whitepaper we used to build interest in our protocol, early in 2018, before we had a team, or funding. Its a useful look into some of our early thinking, but should no longer be considered a source of truth for the protocol design.

## Specs
### WIP - ![WIP Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/stage-wip-%23C25F38.svg)
 - [Hybrid Network](./specs/graph-protocol-v1) - This specification is a hybrid protocol design, intended to bridge the gap between our [hosted service](http://thegraph.com) and our fully decentralized network design. Important elements of the decentralized network are covered here, including economic mechanisms, interfaces and overall architecture. Several elements are notably still centralized, such as the dispute management process and governance.

## Implementations

üî® = In Progress

## Contributing
If you have questions about the contents of this repo, feel free to ask questions in the #research channel of our [Discord](http://thegraph.com/discord).

We don't yet have a formal improvement proposal process, but feel free to submit ideas for improvements to the protocol as issues in this repo.

If you spot an error, gap or useful clarification in one of the specs or papers, feel free to file an issue (or if it is small, submit a PR directly), and you may be listed as a contributor on the spec, if your issue is accepted üôÇ.

We look forward to some great contributions from our community, thank you in advance! üóø‚ú®üöÄ
